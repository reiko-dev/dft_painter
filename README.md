### DFT_DRAWER
The DFT_DRAWER is an app made with flutter which draws shapes from the user using the Discret Fourier Transform (DFT) algorithm.

## Inspiration
Inspired by the videos about DFT drawing on [The Coding Traing](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain) channel of our friend Daniel Shiffman!
